Step 6: Publish to npm

To publish your first version to npm run:

tsc
npm publish

Now you're all set to go! Consume your library anywhere you want by running:

npm install --save hwrld

and consume it using

import {sayHello} from 'hwrld'
sayHello();

For subsequent releases, use the semvar principle. When you make a patch / bugfix to your library, you can run npm version patch, for new features run npm version minor and on breaking changes of your api run npm version major.
